<h2>What types of questions should I avoid asking?</h2>
<p>First, make sure that your question is <b>on-topic for this site</b>.</p>
<ul>
<li>every answer is equally valid: “What’s your favorite ______?”</li>
<li>your answer is provided along with the question, and you expect more answers: “I use ______ for ______, what do you use?”</li>
<li>there is no actual problem to be solved: “I’m curious if other people feel like I do.”</li>
<li>you are asking an open-ended, hypothetical question: “What if ______ happened?”</li>
<li>your question is just a rant in disguise: “______ sucks, am I right?”</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Some subjective questions are allowed, but “subjective” does not mean “anything goes”. All subjective questions are expected to be <i>constructive</i></b>. What does that mean? Constructive subjective questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>inspire answers that explain “why” and “how”</li>
<li>tend to have long, not short, answers</li>
<li>have a constructive, fair, and impartial tone</li>
<li>invite sharing experiences over opinions</li>
<li>insist that opinion be backed up with facts and references</li>
<li>are more than just mindless social fun</li>
</ul>

	<h2>How do I ask a Good Question?</h2>
	<p>We’d love to help you. To <b>improve your chances</b> of getting an answer, here are some tips:</p>

<h6>Search, and research</h6>

<p>...and keep track of what you find. Even if you don't find a useful answer elsewhere on the site, including links to related questions that <em>haven't</em> helped can help others in understanding how your question is different from the rest. </p>

<h6>Write a title that summarizes the specific problem</h6>

<p>The title is the first thing potential answerers will see, and if your title isn't interesting, they won't read the rest. So <em>make it count:</em></p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Pretend you're talking to a busy colleague</strong> and have to sum up your entire question in one sentence: what details can you include that will help someone identify and solve your problem? Include any error messages, key APIs, or unusual circumstances that make your question different from similar questions already on the site. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Spelling, grammar and punctuation are important!</strong> Remember, this is the first part of your question others will see - you want to make a good impression. If you're not comfortable writing in English, ask a friend to proof-read it for you. </p></li>
<li><p>If you're having trouble summarizing the problem, <strong>write the title <em>last</em></strong> - sometimes writing the rest of the question first can make it easier to describe the problem. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Examples:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Bad:</strong> C# Math Confusion</li>
<li><strong>Good:</strong> Why does using float instead of int give me different results when all of my inputs are integers?</li>
<li><strong>Bad:</strong> [php] session doubt</li>
<li><strong>Good:</strong> How can I redirect users to different pages based on session data in PHP?</li>
<li><strong>Bad:</strong> android if else problems</li>
<li><strong>Good:</strong> Why does str == "value" evaluate to false when str is set to "value"?</li>
</ul>

<h6>Introduce the problem before you post any code</h6>

<p>In the body of your question, start by expanding on the summary you put in the title. Explain how you encountered the problem you're trying to solve, and any difficulties that have prevented you from solving it yourself. The first paragraph in your question is the second thing most readers will see, so make it as engaging and informative as possible. </p>

<h6>Help others reproduce the problem</h6>

<p>Not all questions benefit from including code. But if your problem is <em>with</em> code you've written, you should include some. But <strong>don't just copy in your entire program!</strong> Not only is this likely to get you in trouble if you're posting your employer's code, it likely includes a lot of irrelevant details that readers will need to ignore when trying to reproduce the problem. Here are some guidelines:</p>

<ul>
<li>Include just enough code to allow others to reproduce the problem. </li>
<li>If it is possible to create a live example of the problem that you can <em>link</em> to (for example, on http://sqlfiddle.com/ or http://jsbin.com/) then do so - but <strong>also copy the code into the question itself.</strong> Not everyone can access external sites, and the links may break over time.</li>
<li><strong>DO NOT post images of code, data, error messages, etc.</strong> - copy or type the text into the question. Please reserve the use of images for diagrams or demonstrating rendering bugs, things that are impossible to describe accurately via text.</li>
</ul>

<h6>Include all relevant tags</h6>

<p>Try to include a tag for the language, library, and specific API your question relates to. If you start typing in the tags field, the system will suggest tags that match what you've typed - be sure and read the descriptions given for them to make sure they're relevant to the question you're asking! </p>

<h6>Proof-read before posting!</h6>

<p>Now that you're ready to ask your question, take a deep breath and read through it from start to finish. Pretend you're seeing it for the first time: <em>does it make sense?</em> Try reproducing the problem yourself, in a fresh environment and make sure you can do so using only the information included in your question. Add any details you missed and read through it again. Now is a good time to make sure that your title still describes the problem!</p>
