	  Bug Overflow is a <b>question and answer site for professional and enthusiast programmers.</b> It features questions and answers on a wide range of topics in computer programming.
	  It was created to be a more open alternative to earlier question and answer
	  sites such as Experts-Exchange.
	  <br>

	  <section>
	  The website serves as a platform for users to ask and answer questions, and, through membership and active participation, to vote questions and answers up or down and edit questions
	  and answers in a fashion similar to a wiki or Reddit.Users of Stack Overflow can earn reputation points and "badges"; for example, a person is awarded 10 reputation points for receiving an "up" vote on an
	  answer given to a question and 10 points for the "up" vote of a question,and can receive badges for their valued contributions, which represents a gamification of the traditional Q&A site.
	  Users unlock new privileges with an increase in reputation like the ability to vote, comment, and even edit other people's posts.

	  Bug Overflow also has a <b>Jobs section to assist developers in finding their next opportunity.</b> For employers,
	  Bug Overflow provides tools to brand their business, 
	  advertise their openings on the site, and source candidates from Stack Overflow's database of developers who are open to being contacted.

	  Bug Overflow has received <b>general praise for its architecture of handling questions and answers as they are regulated by the community.</b> Its success has often been attributed to self-regulation.

A study from the University of Maryland found that Android developers that used only Stack Overflow as their programming resource tended to write more insecure code than those who used only the official Android developer documentation from Google.


Bug Overflow won the 2020 Webby <b>Peopleâ€™s Voice Award for Community in the category Web.</b>
